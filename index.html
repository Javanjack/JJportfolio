	<h2> Background</h2>
		 
	 
    <h3><b>University</b></h3>
	<p> I initially attended the University of the West Indies as a Statistics and Economics major for one year
	Then in 2019 I transfered over to ASU to do a Mathematics degree with a concentration in Statistics, which I then graduated from in 2022.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3><b>Current</b></h3>
	<p>At the moment, I work remotely in YTEPP as a Helpdesk Student Support Advocate where I primarily offer support to learners on the Coursera platform
	, as well as organise office hour meetings and appointment meetings. Additionally I assisted in the creating and curation of learning tracks on topics like AI and Machine Learning and Cybersecurity by 
		researching courses in those fields utilizing knowledge of programming and Statistics as guidance in course selection. I also assist in conducting large online orientation meetings on Microsoft Teams
		where I help in presentations.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
