	<li>Utilised wordpress.com to create and design a website that contains reviews of manga that I have read, with a monthly reader count of 40 persons with a 50%
		US audience (<a href ="https://jsmangacritique.com/"> <br>Jsmangacritique</a>|2023) </li>
		
        <li>Used R and R markdown to make use of regression algorithms on school data from the University of

educational resources on Kalboard 360, a learning management system, against numerous other variables (2022)</li>
		
	<li>Coded numerous regressions using SAS to determine the optimal model for the daily stock price of West 
Pharmaceuticals against other health companies' daily stock prices. (2021) </li>

renewable energy in Arizona alongside 2 group members (<a href ="https://bigeater459.wixsite.com/renewablereach"> <br>RenewableReach</a>|2020). </li>
		
	<li>Used JavaFx to create an animated GUI that allowed a user to input text that would then, with button presses, be able to move, stop or be cleared.
